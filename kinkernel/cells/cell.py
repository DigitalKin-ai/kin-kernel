"""
This module provides the implementation of `Cell`, a concrete subclass of `BaseCell`.

The `Cell` class serves as a base for creating specific cell implementations that adhere to the
interface and behavior defined by `BaseCell`. It is designed to be subclassed to provide the
necessary `role`, `description`, `input_format`, `output_format`, and an implementation of the
`execute` method tailored to the specific requirements of the cell being implemented.

Example usage and subclassing details are provided within the docstring of the `Cell` class.

See Also:
    kinkernel.cells.base.BaseCell: The abstract base class from which `Cell` inherits.

.. note::
    While `Cell` is intended for subclassing, it can also be instantiated directly if no
    additional functionality is required beyond what is provided by `BaseCell`.

    A concrete implementation of the BaseCell class.

    This class is meant to be used as a base for specific cell implementations
    that do not require additional attributes or methods beyond those provided by BaseCell.
    Subclasses of this class should provide specific `role`, `description`,
    `input_format`, `output_format`, and implement the `execute` method.

    Example:
        class MyCell(Cell[MyInputModel, MyOutputModel]):
            role = 'example_role'
            description = 'An example cell implementation.'
            input_format = MyInputModel
            output_format = MyOutputModel

            def execute(self, input_data: MyInputModel) -> MyOutputModel:
                # Implementation of cell logic goes here.
                pass

    Note that this class can be directly instantiated if no additional functionality is needed.

    Usage:
        # Assuming MyInputModel and MyOutputModel are defined and imported Pydantic models
        my_cell = Cell[MyInputModel, MyOutputModel]()
        result = my_cell.execute(my_input_data)
